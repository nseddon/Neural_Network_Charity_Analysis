# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview of the loan prediction risk analysis:

The purpose of this analysis was to develop a neural network to assist determining which organizations should be considered for funding from AlphabetSoupCharity.  Using previously obtained data of organizations that have been awarded or denied funding, the neural network is to be trained on multiple inputs to finally classify future organization requests for funding.

## Results:

#### Data Preprocessing
-  What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
    -  The target of IS_SUCCESSFUL is currently the only target for the model.
-  What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
-  What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?

#### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
-  How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
-  Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
-  What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?

## Summary:

Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.
